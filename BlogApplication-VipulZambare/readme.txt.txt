Application Name: Blog Application
Developer: Vipul Zambare

Application is developed using .NET framework 4.x and ASP.NET MVC 5 web application framework
Entity Framework ORM is used for DB connectivity.

Requirements covered:

Admin user:
	1. Blog Create Page
	2. Rich text editor for blog content
	3. List of Blogs
	4. Changing status of blog
	5. Show Details of blog

Not covered requirements:
	1. Login page and user roles ex: Admin, Editor
	2. Editor View of blog app
	3. Create/Edit of blog by admin


Possible improvements I would like to do if I get 2-3 more days:
	1. Unit testing
	2. Completing all requirements 
	3. Secure storage of passwords and login
	
Steps to execute application:
	1. Run database script file named "blog-db-script-vipul-zambare"
	2. Extract and open zip "BlogApplication-VipulZambare"
	3. Run solution file "BlogApplication-VipulZambare.sln"
	4. Run application. 

Note: 
Application should create database as I have used Entitiy framework (code first approach), 
But I have added sql script to create some dummy data.
